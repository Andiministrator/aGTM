## Debugging

You can check the output of the Consent Check within your Browser Console.

Open your Browser Console (Button "F12" in most cases), type `aGTM` and press "Enter".
You'll get the object aof aGTM. Open it using the small arrow (click on "â–º").

Now you see a lot of data from aGTM, ordered by letters - but we need only a few pieces of data:

- "c" stands for configuration - here you can find, what configuration options were used by aGTM.

- "d" stands for data - here yo find all data of aGTM (mostly within sub-objects).
  Following the information of "d" what we need:
  
  - "cm" stands for Consent Mode (data).
  
  - "consent" stands for Consent Information - here you'll find whether the consent was accepted or not (yet) and for what purposes/services the Consent was given.
    Following some explanations:
    
    - "hasResponse" - if this parameter is false, we have no consent information yet. If it is true, the consent information is available (either the user gave it or the CMP restored it from a cookie).
    
    - "feedback" - this is a readable short information about the users choise.
    
    - "blocked" - the Consent Tool was blocked by a Tracking Blocker.
